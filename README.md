# Coding-Files

This repository contains basic coding snippets for various data processing and plotting tasks. It aims to help users quickly implement common operations on Excel and text files.

## Repository Overview

This repository includes several Python scripts for data analysis and visualization:

- **read_data.py** and **read_data1.py**: These scripts contain functions for reading data from text and Excel files.
- **process_data1.py**: This script processes the read data, generating statistical summaries and outputting the results to a specified file.
- **plotting.py**: This script generates plots from the processed data, allowing for visual analysis of data trends.
- **main.py** and **main1.py**: These scripts serve as entry points to execute the data processing and visualization workflows, integrating the functions from the other scripts.

The repository is intended to simplify common data analysis tasks, providing reusable code snippets for reading, processing, and plotting data from various file formats.
